# Human-Data Interaction Research Theme

Designing intuitive interfaces between humans and data systems, enabling flow states and creative data use.

## Core Concept

The "Dataflow" research project aims to design human-data interactions where users enter states of optimal creativity (flow), enabling them to design new products with raw data.

## Key Components

- **Intuitiveness**: Datasets that adapt to user needs and data literacy
- **Flow States**: Designing for immersive, productive data experiences
- **Data Redesign Method**: Creating intuitive datasets

## Teaching

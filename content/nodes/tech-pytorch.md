# PyTorch

Deep learning framework for model development, fine-tuning, and inference optimization.

## Experience

- **SLM Production Deployment**: Optimized inference on 4 H100 GPUs at Veltys
- **Model Alignment**: Fine-tuning language models to domain requirements
- **Evaluation Infrastructure**: Building chain-of-thought evaluation systems

## Why PyTorch for Interpretability

PyTorch's eager execution model allows for inspection of intermediate states, crucial for understanding model behavior at each step.

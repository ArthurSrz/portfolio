## Abstract

While smart cities are recently providing open data, how to organize the collective creation of data, knowledge and related products and services produced from this collective resource still remains to be thought.

## Research Question

What organizational models can encourage collective co-creation of services among smart city stakeholders functioning as both data providers and users?

## Key Focus

The study investigates how cities like Lisbon can position themselves as platforms that orchestrate synergies among multiple actors to generate data-driven urban solutions.

## Relevance to Current Work

This research laid the groundwork for understanding how to design **interpretable systems** that connect diverse data producers and consumers - a pattern that transfers directly to understanding how to make AI systems interpretable.

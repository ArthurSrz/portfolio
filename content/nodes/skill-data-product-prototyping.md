# Data Product Prototyping

Expert capability in rapidly building functional data products that solve real problems and enable evaluation through Design Science cycles.

## Philosophy

Prototyping is not about building minimum viable products - it's about creating **artifacts that embody theoretical insights** and can be rigorously evaluated against user needs.

## Technical Stack

- **Python** for core logic
- **Streamlit** for rapid UI iteration
- **Neo4j** for knowledge representation
- **LangChain** for LLM integration

## Portfolio Evidence

20+ prototypes built across different domains:
- Open Data tools (Open Data Canvas, Data Redesign Method)
- LLM Interpretability (Inside LLMs Mind, Outside LLMs Mind)
- Knowledge Systems (Borges Graph, Reconciliation API)
- Sentiment Analysis (The New Sentiment)

## Iteration Speed

Following Design Science methodology, I optimize for rapid build-measure-learn cycles, enabling quick refinement of artifacts based on user feedback.

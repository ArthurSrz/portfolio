## Series Overview

### Part 1: The Black Box Problem
Addressing why LLMs appear opaque and how we can approach understanding them.

### Part 2: Surprising Internal Processes
Examining unexpected behaviors in how LLMs process information.

### Part 3: Poetry Generation
How LLMs generate poetry through mechanistic processes - revealing internal structure.

### Part 4: Description vs Behavior
Discrepancies between how we describe LLMs and how they actually behave.

### Part 5: Machine Reasoning
Can machines think? Exploring the possibility of machine thought.

### Part 6: Hallucinations as Natural Behavior
Reframing hallucinations as expected outputs rather than errors.

### Part 7: Poems as License to Kill
Alignment problems and the challenge of encoding human values.

## Key Insight

> "LLMs are not necessarily black boxes. They can be understood as usable and entire lines of reasoning accessible to users who engage creatively with them."

This perspective directly informs my prototype work on **Inside LLMs Mind** and **Outside LLMs Mind**.

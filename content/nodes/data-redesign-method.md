# A Method for Reducing Dataset Complexity

A practical method for transforming complex datasets into intuitive ones that adapt to users' data literacy levels.

## Why Redesign Datasets?

There is a very diverse range of data users whose data literacy and needs differ greatly:
- Some only look for **one piece of information** in the dataset
- Others use data as a **core artifact** of a data product they are making

Yet, these diverse needs have not been considered by open data producers while designing datasets.

## The Method

This method supports open data communities in their effort to:
- **Design new datasets** with interpretability in mind
- **Redesign existing ones** to improve reusability
- **Address societal issues** (climate, health, transparency) through better data

## Research Foundation

The Data Redesign Method is the practical application of the scientific research documented in the [Intuitiveness](https://github.com/ArthurSrz/intuitiveness) project, which establishes the theoretical framework for dataset complexity reduction.

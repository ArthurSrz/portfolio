# Design Science Research Methodology

Deep expertise in the Design Science Research Methodology (DSRM) developed by Hevner et al. (2004). This methodology enables creating IT artifacts that solve real-world problems while contributing to scientific knowledge.

## Key Capabilities

- **Artifact Design**: Creating tools, frameworks, and methods that solve practical problems
- **Kernel Theory Application**: Leveraging scientific theories to inform artifact design
- **Rigorous Evaluation**: Assessing artifacts through demonstration, case studies, and experiments
- **Scientific Communication**: Publishing research that contributes to both theory and practice

## Applications

This skill informs all prototype development, ensuring each artifact is grounded in theory and rigorously evaluated for its practical utility.

# AI Agent Development

Building autonomous AI agents with observable behaviors and self-improving capabilities.

## Core Competencies

- **Agent Architecture**: Designing multi-agent systems with clear role separation
- **Tool Integration**: Enabling agents to use external tools effectively
- **Context Engineering**: Managing and evolving agent context for improved performance
- **Observability**: Building transparent systems where agent decisions are traceable

## Claude Agent SDK Experience

Hands-on experience with Anthropic's Claude Agent SDK:
- Custom tool creation
- Slash command integration
- Subagent orchestration
- Comet ML observability integration

## Philosophy

Agents should be:
1. **Observable** - We should understand why they make decisions
2. **Improvable** - They should learn from interactions
3. **Collaborative** - Multiple specialized agents > one monolithic agent

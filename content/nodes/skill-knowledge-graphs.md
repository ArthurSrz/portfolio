# Knowledge Graph Design

Expert-level capability in designing and implementing knowledge graphs for semantic data representation, interpretability systems, and AI applications.

## Core Competencies

- **Data Modeling**: Creating Neo4j graph schemas optimized for specific query patterns
- **Ontology Design**: Building semantic structures that capture domain knowledge
- **Graph-RAG Integration**: Connecting knowledge graphs with LLM retrieval systems
- **Visualization**: Making complex graph structures navigable and interpretable

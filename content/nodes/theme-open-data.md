# Open Data Reuse Research Theme

Enabling value creation from public data resources through design-driven approaches.

## The Problem

Since France's 2016 Digital Republic Law, public data must be open. But the "open data baby blues" phenomenon shows that availability alone doesn't create reuse.

## Research Contributions

- **Open Data Canvas**: Framework for building reuses from open data
- **Intuitiveness Research**: Making datasets adapt to user data literacy
- **Ecosystem Analysis**: Understanding how smart cities co-create services

## Key Publications

- PhD Thesis: "Building new uses out of open data: a design science approach" (2021)
- ArXiv: "Open data ecosystems: what models to co-create service innovations in smart cities?" (2023)

As an IT & AI Senior Consultant at Veltys, I am in charge of transferring knowledge between non-technical clients and engineers developing statistical models.

My main achievement has been setting up a sovereign Small Language Model (SLM) in production from A to Z. With a team of 2 data engineers, we chose the machine, optimized inference (4 H100 GPU), and aligned the model to answer customer needs. We set an observability infrastructure made of chain-of-thoughts, evaluation datasets and metrics.

I also design knowledge management systems based on interpretable knowledge graphs for deep tech start-ups, acting both as semantic layers for their IT systems and as IP assets to increase valuation.

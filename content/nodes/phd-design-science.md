Doctoral thesis: "Building new uses out of open data: a design science approach"

Acquired deep knowledge of the Design Science Research Methodology (Hevner et al., 2014) which permits taking advantage of cutting-edge scientific knowledge to design new artifacts that tackle user needs.

Main result: Design of the Open Data Canvas, a framework where one can use open components to craft their own process to build reuses out of open data.

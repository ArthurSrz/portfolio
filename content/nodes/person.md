I was raised as a Design Science researcher working on the intricate mechanisms that turn open data into useful artifacts. During the course of my PhD, until now, I have been developing scientific methods and working products that make complex systems interpretable.

As Anthropic's research team has been using the theories of neural coding and representation and developed attribution graphs to make an interpretable version of a LLM, I have been using scientific theories and making artifacts to make sense out of data ecosystem dynamics, deeptech knowledge and lately RAG's internal mechanisms.

**Skills:** Design Research, Data Product Prototyping (Python, Streamlit, Neo4j, Langchain, Scikit-learn), Knowledge Graph Systems, Scientific Writing

# Design rationale

#### Why a Transport Data Map ? 

In rural and suburban areas, it might be hard to find the schedule of the bus that can take you from one place to another, and this is because transport data is rarely accessible for the route planners, and this for several reasons : 

* data may not exist at all
* data producers may have kept the data inside their Information System
* data may have been published but not with an open license that let route planners reuse data
* data is published but route planners do not know about it. 

**The key here is to empower public authorities (legally in charge of public transport data management) so they can tackle any of the problem above.** 

This is where the Transport Data Map comes in.  
#### What is the Transport Data Map ? 

An map-based app assessing the transport data availability of every part of a transportation network and giving info about the data producers to contact if corrective measures need to be taken :

As a member of Datactivist's team, I designed the Open Data Patchwork, a series of resources and tutorials any organisation can use to open data. The patchwork is divided into 6 steps : 

1. Understanding organisation's needs regarding data
2. Sourcing data
3. Setting up a data quality process
4. Publishing data
5. Unlock data value 

## 1. Understanding organisation's needs regarding data
## 2. Sourcing data
## 3. Setting up a data quality process

To set up a data quality process, the patchwork considered 4 steps : 
* [Data cleaning](https://opendatacanvas.org/mise-en-qualite-nettoyer) 
* [Data completion](https://opendatacanvas.org/mettre-en-qualite-compiler)
* [Data standardization](https://opendatacanvas.org/standardiser-donnees) 
* [Data validation](https://opendatacanvas.org/valider-schema-donnees) 

## 5. Publishing data
## 6. Unlock data value

# Design rationale

This research explores how datasets can be designed to adapt to users' data literacy levels - making data more intuitive and accessible. It represents the scientific foundation behind the Data Redesign Method.

The paper argues that the next evolution of open data is not just about availability but about intuitiveness - creating datasets that naturally align with how users think and work.

# Design rationale

Since the enactment of the Law for a Digital Republic in 2016, all public localities comprising over 3.500 inhabitants are required to publish their data in an accessible manner, gratuitously, and in such a format to not require the use of any specific software. 

Behind this Law lies the promise of new applications, services and information, resulting from the public use of open data. However, while opening up public data is meant as an encouraging measure for the development of new uses, it is not necessarily guaranteed to succeed. Indeed, since 2016, new uses of public data have been so infrequent, that activists define the current situation as the “open data baby blues”. 

In such a context, the Open Data Canvas was designed to remove the barriers hindering the development of new uses.

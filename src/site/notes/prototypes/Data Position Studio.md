# Design rationale

#### Why a Data Position ?

One "data position" is a tool made for categorizing people based on their data related skills and profile. It is generally used to create groups with a balanced distribution of skills. For example, to constitute teams with at least one technical profile, you need to identify who has technical skills and then distribute them accordingly. 

As a result, one data position is usually made of : 
* one grid of questions
* responses with associated "scores" to measure skills level 
* some reasoning to allocate profiles in a balanced manner

# Technical stack
